[] Restructure CLI
  [] Use subparsers to determine mode we are running
  [] Most options can still be high level (e.g. tcp is highlevel)
  [] --local should be an options under the `simulate` mode to make all tcp addresses local

[] Add playback mode
  - simply allows playing back telemetry and status etc from csv file
  [] add playback cli argument - optionally takes a playback speed
  [] add csv reader for reading playback data

[] Simulation libraries
  - want to be able to write models to simulate robots
  [] archtect the best way to define a robot model in the app and inject that model for dio components




[] Break Control Types out of RobotControl and make control a general interface to follow the open-closed principle

[] Implement AHRS Smart Mode

[] Implement AHRS processing into the robot behaviour
[] Structure sampling/processing of data better
[] Add Navigation
[] Add power status
[] Add file headers and descriptions

[] Robot shouldn't panic without WIFI 
  - problem is in the Runner when robot can not connect to network
  - In this case, it should fall back to it's own network
